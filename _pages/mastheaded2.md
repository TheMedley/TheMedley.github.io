    excerpt: 'Areeb Ahmad is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from Delhi University. Although he is an eclectic bookworm, he swears by all things SFF with Erikson as God and Malazan as Gospel.

He is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from the University of Delhi. You might happen to find him attending a random class in a random college on a random day or looking for a vacant seat in the metro.

    alt: "Govind Gupta"
    title: "Govind Gupta"
    excerpt: 'Majoring in economics, Govind is a melange of fickle passions. With his childhood sheltered in Kolkata, he never gets over his love for the life of that city even though he spent his adolescence in Bokaro and is now residing in the national capital. Gulzar and his lyrics lure him the most and he can listen to Yaman Kalyan for hours, even though he can never sing a line in tune. Govind loves the company of himself and watches doggo videos on Instagram. Narcissist? Not quite.'

On others, she attempts to find the meaning of life in between the lines of Urdu poetry, believing one day she eventually will. She revels in her constant confusion, grappling with new ideas while listening to old Bollywood songs.'

He is a self-proclaimed musical snob, a coffee aficionado and a gamer. He is into poetry (evidently) and seeks art, cine and music as inspiration. Sarthak is often desperately holding onto memories for ‘a lifetime in repeat.’ He is a featured photographer at Unsplash and he’s never not wearing headphones.'

She firmly believes that a long walk can solve more problems than a heated discussion.'
