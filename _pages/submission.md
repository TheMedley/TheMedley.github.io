**The Submission Window for the Fifth Issue of _The Medley_ is now open. The deadline is 20th April.**

For the Fifth Issue of The Medley, we are looking for themed works which examine various modes and roles of **DISSENT** in different arenas of our personal and public lives. Although societies form through some kind of majoritarianism, almost all developed nations have made protection of personal freedom and the right to dissent an essential component of their functioning, considering it exceedingly important for progress. Dissenting, however, has never come freely especially in our increasingly polarised modern world where differences are looked upon as threateningly alien. Dissent carries great personal cost but many individuals have readily paid that price over and over again throughout history. Art, and Literature  specifically, has always been conducive mediums for voicing dissent and we want to explore that relationship.

Non-themed submissions will also be accepted for this issue.

## GENERAL GUIDELINES

We wish to invite themed as well as non-themed entries for the sections of Fiction, Non-Fiction and Poetry, with any variety of style, structure, content and genre. Photo Essays are also welcome. In general, we're looking for work from emerging writers and poets that has unbridled originality, a raw energy and doesn't shy away from coming into its own. We want poetry and prose that sings, fragments itself and takes flight. Give us your best, most daring, pieces, exploring new terrains and new metaphors, pieces that sketch out paths and avenues in an otherwise unknown wasteland. We're looking for diversity, for versatility and for new voices of representation from all over the globe.

**PROSE: Only 1 piece at a time, 2500 words maximum.**<br>
**POETRY: Up to 3 poems at a time, no length limits.**

1. Prose and poetry should ideally be directly pasted in the body of the email. If your work requires special formatting, you may send it as an attachment, preferably in the form of a word document. PDF files are also acceptable.

2. All submissions have to be accompanied by a short third person bio, along with a headshot/photograph of the submitter as an attachment.

3. The category of your work - fiction, non-fiction, poetry - has to be mentioned in the subject of the submission email. Also state whether your submission is themed or non-themed. Before you send work, please familiarize yourself with _The Medley_ and our editorial practices by going through our older issues available on the website.

4. We allow only for previously unpublished works. You can send your entries to submissions[at]themedley[dot]in. We are open to simultaneous submissions (so long as you classify them as such and immediately let us know if theyâ€™re accepted elsewhere).

5. Please submit no more than once per category per reading period. To put it simply, you can submit upto three poems, one fiction piece and/or one non-fiction for any particular issue when the submission window is open. Additional submissions will be ignored. If your work has been featured in _The Medley_ in the past, please wait at least half a year, or one issue, from the date of your publication before submitting again.

6. _The Medley_ requires First Serial Rights and all archival rights. All rights revert back to the author upon publication. If your work appears elsewhere in print or online, please give due credit to _The Medley_ as the place where your work first appeared.
