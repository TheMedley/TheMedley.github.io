One late and silent evening<br>
quite a few winters ago,<br>
_Nosain_ took me in lovingly,<br>
as she did all her children before me.<br>

As I grew a little taller and bolder<br>
reading and playing by her windows,<br>
her corners told me stories<br>
of every smile and tear they’ve seen.<br>

Her garden holds memories<br>
and songs of her little darlings,<br>
and roses, lilacs and bougainvilleas<br>
that reminisce my _aju_ who moulded her.<br>

Throughout she has stood gentle<br>
and witnessed celebrations,<br>
a child’s first words,<br>
and someone’s last cries.<br>

I’ve always felt bright yellow under her roof<br>
despite the sundry passing blues.<br>
Her walls are tinged with traces of my childhood,<br>
my glee, my angst, my secrets, my dreams.<br>

Like birds her sky has allowed<br>
come and go with seasons changing,<br>
I too have flown miles<br>
and oceans away from her.<br>

My mind is not burdened<br>
by the weight and harshness of the world,<br>
for even when I’m cold and weary,<br>
my home will still embrace me.<br>

And so I will march as far as the horizons stretch,<br>
until my shoes are tattered from journeys.<br>
Life is not always rose-coloured glasses,<br>
but _Nosain_ is, and she awaits my return.<br>
