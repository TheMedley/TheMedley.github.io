They told us we'd found<br>
the true spirit of grindcore<br>
but all we had were walks<br>
on the beach and the inevitable<br>
fondnesses for horses<br>
and people that led to instant<br>
eliminations on OKCupid. We<br>
replied that there _was_ no <br>
true spirit of grindcore, <br>
or if there was it had lived<br>
in a jungle somewhere<br>
in Uruguay but starved<br>
in 1997. they did not respond<br>
and so we all sat there, eyes<br>
locked across the table, did<br>
not speak even when<br>
the waitress came to take<br>
our orders. we were all served<br>
the tongue on rye special<br>
with extra sauerkraut. <br>
