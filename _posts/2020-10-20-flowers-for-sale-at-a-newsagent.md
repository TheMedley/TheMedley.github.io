not feeling recently<br>
so very inspired<br>
in spite of birds<br>
which wheel and scatter<br>
on the sky<br>
like salt on bacon.<br>

things wilt<br>
in the wrong<br>
conditions. flowers<br>
on sale<br>
half-price at a newsagent.<br>

a city pent up<br>
like leaves in a doorway,<br>
spread out below me<br>
and crunching with aches,<br>
aching to be touched<br>
and be touched<br>
and be touched.<br>
