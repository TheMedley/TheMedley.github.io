This love heart that pulsed passion
and fluttered and quivered daily
in awkward agile anticipation
has become clogged and congealed.
Now,
the HMO’s of love
deny all requests for treatment
as ‘not officially’ authorized.

I implore you
to let me try
folk remedies.

You refuse citing gross indifference.

The myocardial infarction
occurs
in a poorly worded text message
renouncing any blame
for pain and suffering
incurred
during the previous month’s 
experimental heart treatments.
