### Working Class Houses

There’s never too much space<br>
to live in a house<br>
you can’t call your own.<br>
A kitchen window you can’t open<br>
is much better than none at all.<br>
You put out a fire,<br>
then go to sleep,<br>
you have to go to work tomorrow.<br>
If the bulb in the bathroom flickers-<br>
let it,<br>
turn the tap on and put your head under it.<br>
Don’t cover with paint<br>
the wall which is stained,<br>
wash with ink.<br>
Leave the mirror behind the door so it breaks.<br>
Leave a few pages torn off from your father’s diary.<br>
Leave the verandah light on.<br>
Leave new clothes and old shoes.<br>
Leave something behind, even if it’s for a short time,<br>
It is yours, was-<br>
Leave.<br>

### Untitled

when I ask for a plain cotton washcloth<br>
you give me blue large leather curtains instead,<br>
sunflowers for breakfast on the broken balcony<br>
of a motel<br>
at the edge of an abandoned city.<br>
we are tourists here<br>
never to stay<br>
yet we find each other stealing visiting cards<br>
and gum at the reception.<br>
you will bring a lover who is not me and I you,<br>
here again.<br>
we are not gypsies looking for a home.<br>
we are the paint chipped away on milestones.<br>
we are to go back.<br>
for you have become the road,<br>
but I, the city.<br>
