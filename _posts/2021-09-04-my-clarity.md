The process: the chipped  
paint-frayed window screens, the wasp nests of last year  
that don’t have a purpose, the tufts of old-man-gray  
dusting the yard; all and more toll a passing.  
It attracts a glassy eye.  
Rare clarity has the  
opposite effect of a circling drain, putting back and  
into commission precedent things, ones that still live and 
ones to come, only because they’re given life and infuse 
an idea.  
Consider the words:  
memories follow like shadows painted on 
a page, never completely erased even when  
the bone-house is gone. 
Not quite a Grecian urn—   
more an unfrozen scattering: unbeautiful, untrue  
mirror-flashes from the smallest of all hours.  
But no museum can hold these leavings. Only 
a mind-sized universe can.
