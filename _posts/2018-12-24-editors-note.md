Contrary to popular belief, the most important step, the
hardest step, of a journey is not the first one. As
Sanderson says, it’s the next one, the second one, always
the step that comes after. The Medley’s trajectory
towards publishing has been convoluted and varied. It
had wandered into many places before it took its current
shape in the summer of this year. It felt like a huge load
off of our backs to finally see it materialize and
approximate our long-held vision. But even as we
celebrated the release of the first issue, the immediate
and pressing concern on our minds was the question:
what next?


We knew that we could not let our initial success provide
us a false sense of security and lull us into believing that
it was going to be easy from here on out. Only the first
obstacle had been crossed, the first milestone reached.
The long road was still spread out twisting before us and
it required even more effort on our part to build up on
previous successes, and our past ideals. The immediate
objective after the release of the journal was to come up
with a second issue which was just as good as the first
one, if not better.


Working towards this new issue was not a step upwards,
but a path of tracing newer avenues of shape and form in
the small, microcosmic literary world that emerging
writers interact with in their daily lives. This was an
exploration of alternative creative realities, a project
where young writers could feel comfortable enough to
share their visions and revisions of creative expression as
they go through the motions of their college selves and
attempt to process the impressions which come upon
their minds.


Some central themes emerge in the works we accepted,
but most of them return to that one idea we wished to
stay true to: the examination of the self and of what
constitutes one’s identity. Whether it’s through exploring
the functioning of physical spaces and locations, or the
way the individual relates to its close institutional or
familial environment, or perhaps even with oneself, there
is that soul-searching most of us engage with as we grow
older to acquire versions of ourselves. We hope each of
these pieces make you think, challenge you and,
ultimately, help you encounter a crossroads of ideas.
