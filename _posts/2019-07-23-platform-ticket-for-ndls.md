A cow shits lazily at your entrance. <br>

Several other media plug into you like <br>
you're a giant, heaving, living spikebuster <br>
like you're a diabetic heart on the verge of cardiac arrest. <br>

I ascend your steps with the lazy confidence of familiarity. <br>

Others do not share this with me. <br>

This place throngs with frightened microbes <br>
who pat their left and right pockets to see <br>
if anyone's stolen their wallets and phones.<br>

None of them trust each other. <br>
All of them trust you. <br>

I am not here to go anywhere. You <br>
are not a means to an end nicer than You <br>
are not grimy heat I must suffer through. You <br>
are everything to me. <br>

You'll find me by the enquiries office <br>
drinking cheap tea and looking away from the moon. <br>

I am only here for you.<br>
