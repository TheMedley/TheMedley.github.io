Your great-grandfather wasn't part of the resistance.<br>
He served the war years on the wrong side.<br>
The best you can hope for is that he despised himself.<br>
Otherwise, you're descended from a proud goose-step,<br>
a committed jackboot.<br>

You do the best you can in life.<br>
You wonder if he did the same.<br>
Maybe there was a hint of sarcasm<br>
in those salutes to his superiors.<br>
Or he couldn't wait to tear off that uniform <br>
when he was somewhere alone.<br>

You've always felt ordinary,<br>
You got that from your old man.<br>
Work hard, get by. If you're a hero,<br>
you're the kind who'll give a dollar to a homeless man.<br>
Could you really fight back against a power that controlled you?<br>
Or would you merely fall into line?<br>

At least, from all you've been able to discover,<br>
he didn't serve in the camps. <br>
He was just a soldier trying to survive,<br>
no different from the ones he was shooting at,<br>
who were shooting at him.<br>

But shame is running out of excuses.<br>
And though once you felt trapped by your ignorance,<br>
now there's no escape from what you know.<br>
