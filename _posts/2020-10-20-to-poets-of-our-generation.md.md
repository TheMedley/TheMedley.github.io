I fear we are singing to ourselves,<br>
Chanting love songs<br>
Across a candle-lit and empty time<br>
Between the backs of our minds. <br>

We found long ago that our parents<br>
Were as dead as their ancestors, <br>
That their minds barely fuzz<br>
Through the centuried routines<br>
Of their existence. <br>

Quizzically, victoriously, <br>
We lost them. <br>
We lost half our families. <br>

We found then<br>
That our friends grew up<br>
Into the yeses and the noes, <br>
The loves and the hates. <br>
And in the intensity we had to divide<br>
The us from the them. <br>

Decidedly, though tearfully, <br>
We washed them away. <br>
We lost half our friends. <br>

We found that the people <br>
On buses and radios, <br>
The little old people<br>
And the blank young men, <br>
Said terrible things about our heroes<br>
And terrible things about our hopes. <br>

Positively, thoroughly, <br>
We cut them off. <br>
We lost half the country. <br>

Look around then. <br>
See who reads your poems: <br>
Dead letter critics, <br>
Other hopeful poets. <br>

And we come to see<br>
That the only hope<br>
is the one song<br>
that we can come together<br>
and sing in so loud a voice<br>
all together<br>
come together<br>
and sing it now, <br>
sing<br>

Truth. <br>

Now. <br>

Truth. <br>

And maybe the echoes <br>
Of the force<br>
Of all the joy<br>
We have ever felt <br>
In being close together<br>
In singing one song<br>
Will make the walls and the buildings<br>
and the illusions<br>
All<br>
Fall<br>
Down. <br>

Otherwise, <br>
We will go on humming, <br>
Rocking, <br>
Cradled in our arms<br>
Until one day the song will freeze, <br>
Bright ribbon in the air, <br>
And crack<br>
Into a million sharp silences. <br>

Silences. <br>
