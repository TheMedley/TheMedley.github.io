<h3>What will you write,</h3>
  <br>
  when your hands droop<br>
  impotent <br>
  and your thoughts are paralyzed.<br>
  <br>
  What will glimmer in this gleaming oblivion?<br>
  <br>
  Compose yourself first.<br>
  <br>
  Pick up your pen and<br>
  touch the cold paper again,<br> 
  with your wrinkled fingertips â€”<br>
  <br>
  For how long will you<br>
  revel in and rebel against <br>
  virtual delights?<br>
  <br>
  One of these days,<br>
  you must sully your hands.<br>
  <br>
