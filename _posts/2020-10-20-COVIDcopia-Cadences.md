Strange TMI factoids we learn<br>
trawling<br>
through<br>
progressions of non-dark websites<br>
regards all manner<br>
of TP [hint: not tooth paste].<br>

For example, I didn't know<br>
supply-chain rhythms<br>
producing residential<br>
and commercial<br>
toilet paper certainly weren't supposed <br>
to -- plus don't mesh<br>

or that while the former's rush-order tempo<br>
appears generally all sold out,<br>
latter is still widely available for delivery<br>
since nowa-stay-in-place-days<br>
our homes are occupied<br>
more than mostly dimmed office building stalls.<br>

Thus during berserk time of need<br>
those humongous one-ply rolls<br>
simply sit in warehouses<br>
waiting on drumrolls<br>
calling us to return from unemployment<br>
back toward pulse of industrial-strength workplace crappers.<br>

Other hand, oh boy, yesterday marked a big Internet success<br>
what with _Mr. Popper's Penguins_<br>
arrived to Zoom<br>
with grandkids well as replacement battery<br>
for this mid-septuagenarian's <br>
do-it-yourself- Philip's HeartStart defibrillator.<br>
