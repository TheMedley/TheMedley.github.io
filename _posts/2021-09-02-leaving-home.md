### Leaving Home 

The windows churn the sunlight
They provide only bleakness
Every filtered thing is poisoned
Every made thing is  cursed 

Here are the truths I state as verses
Do they spark bewilderment?

The boxes were full of her clothes,
They ate the jewelry that my mother never wore,
They kept the torn sarees warm,
But I didn't take them with me.

Without a body, leaving a space sounds unholy
Without a body, possessions aren't possessions
Anymore.

I left the boxes
They are in the hall room
On the piece of the floor where my mother was to turn into ash

How can I take the belongings away from a place
That has carried her air?

### Submerged 

_My diseases become your diseases
after Kaveh Akbar_

I do not know what to call this
Only that it can kill me
A love like this where there is a latch of your soul hiding in mine
Sharing lead bits and nicotine molecules
We are not truly alive, are we?
Suppose we were and this world was a
reflection of ecstasy
Suppose we were and this world had magic in the ground,
Would we have found each other then?

Please listen to me,
Destruction is sort of a blessing.
I know there is anger in the back of your eyes
I know that rage is the highest degree of a litmus test for a human to show if there is a monster hidden
But I have devoured you
I have loved you so much that I cannot differentiate between eating your heart away-and carrying it with me.

Let's take two pages and write only each other's names
Let's tell the world that the only way to love is to memorize the identity of a person

When I am walking I am also tracing the lines on your toes
Can I ask you a question?
If I were to love someone else, could you shapeshift?

my diseases become your diseases
it is true, be too close to someone and you become a cannibal
maybe we have been using synonyms of love all along
maybe we haven't loved at all
maybe we are just staring at each other
till one of us growls and we are finished
