### For the Tourist at Lal Qila, Delhi

_After Agha Shahid Ali*_

The tourist smiles - forced,<br>
frozen in photographs. <br>
Like a trespasser invited to tea,<br>
the tourist holds babies like porcelain.<br>

The tourist speaks - his speech jagged<br>
like speed bumps on Delhi roads. <br>
He stumbles on syllables that linger <br>
like the aftertaste of curry leaves.<br>

In my city, we wreath white skin<br>
in marigold halos, welcome<br>
foreign feet into homes<br>
like a season-less monsoon.<br>

Fortresses fold like doormats. <br>
Revolutions crumble to dust<br>
that add to Delhi’s pollution.<br>
Face masks appear on familiar faces.<br>

The tourist bargains on fixed prices<br>
and stronger currency devalues artistry,<br>
amputates hands of weavers<br>
while tossing loose change.<br>

The tourist says, “Na, Nahi chahiye”<br>
and just like that there is a lineage<br>
wiped away like Rangoli <br>
the day after Diwali. <br>

The tourist leaves, marigold <br>
petals wither under his feet. <br>
He does not look back.<br>

### Driftwood

<br>
Driftwood: noun.<br>
**1** Wood floating<br>
on a body of water,<br>
cast ashore.<br>
**2** Polished wood,<br>
an ornamental decoration,<br>
welcomed home.<br>

The driftwood in my house,<br>
makes for a centre table.<br>
Oval glass topped,<br>
with no real legs to stand on,<br>
it is an earthquake warning,<br>
wobbly beneath its own weight.<br>

Worn out<br>
by more stillness <br>
than turmoil,<br>
driftwood is uneven,<br>
wears a wrinkled skin,<br>
with scars and gaps <br>
where the water cut through.<br>

Polished black<br>
under a clear glass veil, <br>
it is stuck in monochrome<br>
in technicolour 2019,<br>
feels 35 years out of place,<br>
but rooted at the centre<br>
of every conversation<br>
never moves an inch away.<br>

Driftwood: adjective.<br>
**1** A clash of currents,<br>
waves of my grandmother’s youth<br>
over the tea gardens of Assam<br>
**2** The smell of varnish<br>
stiff like starch in folded sarees,<br>
draped in the balconies of New Delhi.<br>
