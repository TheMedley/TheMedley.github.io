She brings the lipstick close to her lips,<br>
her lipstick becomes more wrinkles<br>
adjacent to the lips than lips,<br>
her hands tremble as she picks up the kajal[^1].<br>

The back of its plastic case<br>
has no specific instructions<br>
for women with trembling hands,<br>
the guidelines have no asterisks<br>
suggesting doting mothers<br>
whose visible nail and hair fat<br>
has suctioned their husbands away<br>
into young, petite, hard-bodied hands,<br>
which hold on to the kajal more tightly.<br>

The instructions are nothing more<br>
than mere mathematical axioms,<br>
old worn-out corollaries for the<br>
Diamond-Skinned, Glass-Eyed,<br>
Extra Supermodel Goddesses<br>
with unflawed DNA for ages.<br>

It has no FYIs to caution that<br>
these kajals have a very small half-life,<br>
that a simple well-directed splash of water<br>
will wash away the momentary charm <br>
which the popcorn-chewing husband has prioritised<br>
over the thrill of _Indian Idol_, over the thrill of<br>
_So You Really Absolutely Wholeheartedly_<br>
_Genuinely Realistically Believe You Can Dance_,<br> 
over the thrill of _Shahi Paneer_[^2],<br>
over the thrill of _Tuborg 500_[^3].<br>

The instructions provide no premonitions<br>
of the recurrence of the knife-scrawled blisters<br>
that the cactus-mouthed mother-in-law<br>
will happily gift her after the cessation<br>
of the blackness of her eyes<br>
The guidelines show no other trembling hands,<br> 
no other distress-signalled breasts,<br>
reaching out to get them away from mirrors,<br>
away from lipsticks, away from kajals,<br>
away from their husbands and be individual<br>
Estuaries, Lakes, Rivers, Oceans,<br>
Cyclones, Thunderstorms, Apocalypses.<br>

My mother still with trembling hands,<br>
like an amateur magician<br>
who has not perfected her tricks,<br>
misdirects her bangles, lockets, lipsticks,<br>
and asks me, "Son, how do I look?"<br>
and I with a smile tell her that<br>
she looks like the most beautiful woman<br>
I have ever seen,<br>
like every other mother,<br>
like every other woman.<br>
