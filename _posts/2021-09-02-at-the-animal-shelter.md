### At the Animal Shelter After Dark 

From the deep end of the unlit
parking lot the full moon looks
savory as a macaroon. Clouds
too thin to conceal anything
sweep along, drooling snowflakes
that burst against my upturned face.
 
You prefer waiting in the light
cast from the shelter doorway.
We’re planning to adopt a cat,
but because of the pandemic
the shelter can accommodate
only one couple at a time.
 
The cold shrugs through me with sobs
of self-pity. Two dumpsters loom
in the dark, green steel, monumental,
Egyptian with emphatic form.
 
We’ve already lost our turn
to an eager young pair
so cat-hungry we have to question
their mutual sanity. You watch
through the glass door as they fuss
over paperwork, their forty-dollar
adoption fee already laid out
in plain cash on the counter.
 
I’d rather watch the moon leer
through the vague and restless sky.
It often illuminates body parts
daylight hardly ever encounters.
 
Not tonight, though. Too cold
for noodling in parked pickup trucks
or lying in grass by the river.
 At this far end of February
snow sulks two feet deep in meadows.
The ice on the lakes is thick enough
to discourage even fisherfolk
who arrive with gas-powered drills.   
                            
You gesture for me to join you
inside the shelter where a cat
lately abandoned needs us
to encourage a healthy appetite
and growth of a richer pelt.
 
The moon looks too aloof to notice
whether I’m watching it or not.
Willing to transcend my species,
I follow you indoors where
the brilliant lamplight washes away
the worst of my sinful thinking.

### A View of the Pacific 

A footbridge spanning a gorge
a thousand feet deep, a strip
of chromium river wrinkling
as it shrugs itself out to sea.
 
The Pacific lolls stark naked
with its favorite birds clinging.
Inland, the river source tinkles
down a far-off mountain slope.
 
Let’s join the other tourists
and browse across the bridge with
only casual glances down.
Yes, I know you need photos
 
to prove that this earth-slot exists,
but better to buy a postcard
than risk the vertigo for which
old-timers like us are famous.
 
Rather than lean over the rail
and look down I stare straight west
to the aqua sea horizon
misting the curve of the planet.
 
We mustn’t risk falling that far
into the open maw of the world.
The ocean doesn’t know we’re here,
sparking across this little bridge
 
with its massive overview.
The great bulk of water ignores us
and goes about its sloppy business,
trespassing on our properties
 
without the slightest taint of motive.
I’d better look inland where
folded hills look as cozy
as fat people after a meal.
 
You can look anywhere you want,
but please keep away from the rails
and don’t let the drop to the bottom
maim everything we stand for.
