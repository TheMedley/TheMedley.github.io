I am a twenty two year old reservoir<br>
Ready to cave in<br>
Like a suicidal blood clot<br>
I put my name in the goblet<br>
For a space program<br>
I know there is no returning from<br>
My chest<br>
Feels heavy and empty at the same time<br>
Like a school bus in a ghost town<br>
If depression and suicidal thoughts were parallel lines<br>
They intersect<br>
On the palm of my hand<br>
I will make a bad delivery guy<br>
Because I am a sucker<br>
For breakdowns<br>
Like Walter Benjamin on his last trek<br>
I barely keep myself together<br>
A manâ€™s bare body post postmortem<br>
I am the ash<br>
At the end of the crash<br>
Running a marathon with a walking stick<br>
A first responder<br>
Who has lung cancer<br>
With government sleeping on the compensation check<br>
If an item at a store says<br>
If you break it, you buy it<br>
I break it<br>
A hopeless mountaineer buried in avalanche<br>
Sisyphus, zero<br>
Boulder, won<br>
I have regrets<br>
But the radio operators do not understand<br>
The remorse code<br>
My search party had no volunteers<br>
But when I tied a rock around my ankle<br>
They helped me drag it to the lake<br>
<br><br>

_Epilogue_

### Part I

A pirate<br>
Who sleepwalks<br>
With a chainsaw<br>
Inside a cell<br>
A yard bird<br>
Swallowing fuck yous<br>
And say aye instead<br>
Lie instead<br>
A bard<br>
Bleating for help<br>
Bleeding for help<br>
But word to the wise<br>
(shhheep) <br>
It will never be heard<br>
Because the villagers have trust issues<br>
After a shepherd cried wolf<br>
Until the real one arrived<br>

### Part II

A decaying talented tail-ender<br>
I compose in my sleepwalk<br>
Like a kitchen compost<br>
My imagination is fertile<br>
Overflowing bile<br>
I take liver medicines for dinner<br>
A sinner<br>
Wearing a wooden collar<br>
Pouring wine to the sailors<br>
And sleeping in the cellar<br>
Dreaming of a crash<br>
So the sheep can escape<br>
Graze against the dying of the light<br>
The pirate can always<br>
Blame it on the shipwreck<br>
And hide the chainsaw<br>
Inside one of the wine barrels<br>
Lamb to the slaughter, bitch<br>
Except the lamb is free<br>
And the pirate<br>
Can finally compose<br>
Finally compost<br>
Without bleeding<br>
