    title: "Areeb Ahmad"
    excerpt: 'Areeb Ahmad is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from Delhi University. Although he is an eclectic bookworm, he swears by all things SFF with Erikson as God and Malazan as Gospel. He is currently interning as an associate member for Feeding India, a non-profit organisation which primarily redistributes extra leftover food acquired through donations to the needy. Areeb has been writing since he was in sixth grade and would really like to finally finish working on a book of his own one of these days. He can be found desperately searching for book deals and rapidly accumulating his TBR pile.'

    title: "Prashant Chaudhary"
    excerpt: 'If you’ve been to Hansraj and have seen this guy running and sweating wildly with a baggy shirt and a pair of headphones on, you’ve probably met Prashant. He is currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in English Literature from the University of Delhi. You might happen to find him attending a random class in a random college on a random day or looking for a vacant seat in the metro. If he looks worried, he’s just wondering what to eat next or how to sneak out.'

    title: "Ira Patole"

She has a genuine interest in exploring cultures around her and believes that people are beautiful. Ira’s favourite de-stressers are baking and watching cheesy action movies. Her favourite pastime is scouring the internet for all the wonderful online courses she wants to do and then never opening those bookmarked pages again.'

    title: "Satyam Srivastava"
    excerpt: 'Satyam Srivastava is a second-year Chemistry student at Hansraj College, University of Delhi. Like many of us, he started writing poems for his high-school crush. After an expected failure there, he moved on to different themes and other ideas. He is a sports enthusiast and practices air-rifle shooting at an amateur level. His prime interests lie in literature, music, and spirituality. Lately he has also developed a liking for Hollywood movies and binges on them frequently.'

    alt: "Govind Gupta"
    title: "Govind Gupta"
    excerpt: 'Majoring in economics, Govind is a melange of fickle passions. With his childhood sheltered in Kolkata, he never gets over his love for the life of that city even though he spent his adolescence in Bokaro and is now residing in the national capital. Gulzar and his lyrics lure him the most and he can listen to Yaman Kalyan for hours, even though he can never sing a line in tune. Govind loves the company of himself and watches doggo videos on Instagram. Narcissist? Not quite.'

    title: "Sanghmitra Jethwani"
    excerpt: 'Sanghmitra Jethwani is a third-year English Literature student at Hansraj College, Delhi University. On most days, she tries to capture the tales recited by the streets of Delhi through her lens, to find stories and faces that have been buried for too long. On others, she attempts to find the meaning of life in between the lines of Urdu poetry, believing one day she eventually will. She revels in her constant confusion, grappling with new ideas while listening to old Bollywood songs.'

    excerpt: 'Soumya Vats is a second-year English Literature student. She has worked as a Content Writer and Editor for SoDelhi and Web Content Manager for Kiran Nadar Museum of Art. She has completed Literature and Experimental Writing courses from Brown University and University College of London and is now trying her hand at Spoken Word Poetry. Soumya’s knack for conspiracy theories and true crime makes her an aspiring crime documentary maker. For now, she delights in the art of everyday storytelling.'

    title: "Sarthak Kwatra"
    excerpt: 'Bukowski says, “You won’t see him often, for wherever the crowd is, he is not.” Sarthak is pursuing an undergraduate degree in Economics from Hansraj College, University of Delhi. He is a self-proclaimed musical snob, a coffee aficionado and a gamer. He is into poetry (evidently) and seeks art, cine and music as inspiration. Sarthak is often desperately holding onto memories for ‘a lifetime in repeat.’ He is a featured photographer at Unsplash and he’s never not wearing headphones.'

    alt: "Vidushi Arya"
    title: "Vidushi Arya"
    excerpt: 'Vidushi Arya is a first-year student of Commerce at Hansraj College. Of the few things which are absolutely necessary for a happy life, she considers coffee, reading, music and heart-to-heart conversations the basic requirements. With a love for words and colours that go beyond the horizon, she spends her days trying to match balance sheets and memorising lyrics of her favourite pop songs. She firmly believes that a long walk can solve more problems than a heated discussion.'

As the son of an editor, he had access to books in abundance and enjoys the fantasy worlds of Tolkien, Sapkowski, Pratchett and Erikson. When he’s not coding or pushing pixels, you can find him talking about his experiences at tech conferences.'
