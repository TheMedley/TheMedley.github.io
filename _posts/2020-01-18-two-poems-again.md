## 1947 

Punjab wails <br>
borders turn red <br>
a storyteller collects letters <br>
left behind <br>
no stamps. no addresses. <br> 
she hides them in bloodstained wells <br>
nostalgia becomes an antidote for amnesia. <br>
at night, the well overflows with tales <br>
flooding the city with memory. <br>
the radio comes alive <br>
asking <br>
are you listening? <br>
are you breathing? <br>

<br><br>

## origin

my father<br>
a man of<br>
Awadhi, Bangla, Urdu and Hindavi<br>
smiles when his firstborn<br>
whispers in a foreigner's tongue<br>
it is not the language of the colonizer.<br>
it is not the language of our ancestors when they left Nepal. <br>
it's syllables arranged by a Latin god somewhere in Europe, spreading through South America. <br>
leaving morphemes in the Mediterranean. <br>
a simple sentence on my lips<br>
makes a man of many tongues smile<br>
“She is turning into a _pardesi!_” He exclaims<br>
i want to tell him<br>
that I am a foreigner<br>
in my own land<br>
a native<br>
in the enemy's land<br>
my birth certificate<br>
holds no proof<br>
of my tryst with identities<br>
i struggle to pronounce my own name<br>
_Victorious._ <br>
_Goddess of victory._ <br>
a goddess bereft of identity. <br>
a goddess relying on vernacular memory. <br>
the devnagirī flowing from my parent's fingers<br>
is incomprehensible to me<br>
my tongue sits behind my<br>
front two teeth<br>
when I talk<br>
rolling itself naturally, yet unusually<br>
when I talk. <br>
rolling R's strangely<br>
when I talk. <br>
i want to ask him<br>
do passport stamps and lease papers<br>
know where you truly belong? <br>
i want to tell him<br>
i find homes in-between borders, <br>
my mother tongue a stutter in my mouth. <br>
the only proof of my innocence<br>
are the words that linger<br>
on the nape of my neck, <br>
in the lump in my throat, <br>
in the crevices of my fingers<br>
in the curve of my spine<br>
words<br>
in different scripts<br>
with coordinates attached<br>
memories strung in every syllable<br>
pulling me closer<br>
and letting me go<br>
